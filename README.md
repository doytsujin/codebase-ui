Unison Codebase UI
==================

![CI](https://github.com/unisonweb/codebase-ui/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Running Development Server
--------------------------

1. Start `ucm` and copy the API URL (this URL is uniquely generated by `ucm` at
   start-up) from the `ucm` start-up output (`ucm` also outputs a UI URL, but
   this isn't used when developing for the UI/running the UI from this
   repository).

2. Make sure the latest dependencies are installed with by running `npm install`

3. Start the development server, run: `API_URL="<API URL FROM UCM>" npm start`

4. Visit `http://localhost:1234` in a browser.

Generating Icon Sprite
----------------------

To add new icons, copy the svg markup to the `/public/img/icons.svg` file with
a wrapping `<symbol>` tag with an `id`. The color (`fill` or `stroke`) of the
shape must be
[`currentColor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/color).

Additionally new icons added needs a new variant in `/src/UI/Icons.elm`.

This whole process is manual and not amazing, but happens rarely.
