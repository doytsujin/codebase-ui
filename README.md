Unison Codebase UI
==================

![CI](https://github.com/unisonweb/codebase-ui/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Running Development Server
--------------------------

1. Start `ucm` in headless mode (`ucm headless`) and copy the API URL (this URL
   is uniquely generated by `ucm` at start-up) from the `ucm` start-up output
   (`ucm` also outputs a UI URL, but this isn't used when developing for the
   UI/running the UI from this repository).

2. Make sure the latest dependencies are installed with by running `npm install`

3. Start the development server, run: `API_URL="<API URL FROM UCM>" npm start`

4. Visit `http://localhost:1234` in a browser.

Adding new Icons
----------------

To add new icons, copy the SVG markup to a new function in `/src/UI/Icon.elm`
following the convention seen there of other icons. The color (`fill` or
`stroke`) of the shape must be
[`currentColor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/color).
